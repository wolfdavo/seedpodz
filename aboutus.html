        <p>Some of you have seen Bee Movie -- the 2007 animated film that praises bees for making the world go ‘round, while raising awareness to the declining bee population. This fun movie motivated me to help, but how?</p>

        <p>I felt powerless to help bring back the bees until I heard about Masanobu Fukuoka’s success story. This Japanese gardener introduced seed bombs; mix together a few ingredients, add seeds and throw. Loved it!!  But still an effort to make.</p>

        <p>I wanted an even easier way for anyone, first time gardener or prowess conservationist, to create habitats for bees and other beneficial bugs. With New Leaf Seedpodz, it is just that easy!  Pick up a bag from the store and immediately begin tossing or planting colorful conservation spots anywhere!</p>

        <p>Thanks for your partnership!</p>
