        <p>Some of you have seen <i>Bee Movie</i> -- the 2007 animated film that praises bees for making the world go ‘round while raising awareness about the declining bee population. </p>

        <p>This fun movie motivated me to help. But how?  I felt powerless to help bring back the bees until I heard about Masanobu Fukuoka’s success story. This Japanese gardener introduced the simple seed bomb solution -- mix soil and seeds to throw and go. </p>

        <p>Loved the concept! But I wanted an even easier way for anyone-- from first time gardener to veteran conservationist -- to create habitats for bees and other beneficial bugs. </p>

        <p>With New Leaf Seedpodz it is just that easy!  </p>

        <p>Our family developed a secret recipe for our signature Seedpodz with the dome top and flat bottom so you can toss it or plant it successfully wherever you want colorful conservation to grow. </p>

        <p>We use only high-quality annual and perennial seeds (non-GMO) with proven germination rates in growing zones 2 thru 9; nutrient rich soil made from compost; and, finally, the right type and amount of clay binder to make our Seedpodz open in the rain and bloom in the sunshine. </p>

        <p>For all five of our seed blends we hand mix ingredients in 20-quart salad bowls; hand shape the Seedpodz and dry them without killing seeds through premature germination. </p>

        <p>Because we cherish sustainability at New Leaf Seedpodz, lots of eco-friendly consideration goes into every step of our conservation-related work -- from our commitment to use only non genetically modified organism seeds to our natural cotton bag packaging and no gloss, compostable tag.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your partnership!</p>
